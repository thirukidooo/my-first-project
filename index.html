  <p style="color:darkred;"> This is the story of <b><i>thirukidoo:=</i></b></p>
  <br>
  <p style="color:darkred;">Two love birds were peeved on each other about some small conflict. Silence stayed between them for couple of hours. He tried everything to say sorry; held earlobes, made puppy face, but nothing worked on her. Her silence and ignorance was just killing him inside. He gave up cajoling her. He desperately started to find something in every cupboard of rooms. Which caused her to worry, but she remained stiff and silent. After an hour, her patience went out of stock. Hours of peeved melted into worry to know what heâ€™s searching for. She went right behind him and wrapped her arms over the chest. Peeved attitude was still on her face.</p>
